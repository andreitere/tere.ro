A fun learning project where I recreated the classic Flappy Bird game using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The main goal was to understand core game development concepts like:

- Game loop implementation and animation frame management
- Physics simulation including gravity and collision detection
- Sprite rendering and canvas manipulation
- Input handling and game state management
- Score tracking and difficulty progression

The game features a chubby bird character that players must navigate through a series of pipes by timing their jumps correctly. Each successful pass through pipes increases the score, while collisions end the game.

This project helped me gain some hands-on experience with game development fundamentals and browser-based graphics programming. It was particularly interesting to implement the physics engine from scratch and fine-tune the gameplay mechanics to achieve the right balance of challenge and fun.
