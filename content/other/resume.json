From pure Javascript to jQuery, AngularJS, or Java we had to parse, extract and adapt our i18n strategy to make our product available in multiple languages.\n\nWhile the internationalization task itself was very challenging, the thing I was super proud about was a tool I built via an extension to the SublimeText editor, which will have helped the team easily extract the strings, replace them with library-specific calls for the i18n and then save the matches into the database. With the help of some API written in NodeJS and also some scheduled jobs to easily translate the strings, we saved a great deal of time which we invested in testing and refinements."
