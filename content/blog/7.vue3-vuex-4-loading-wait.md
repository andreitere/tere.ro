Whenever you build a frontend application which calls backend apis and you also need to display the loading state you end up with multiple flags
in your code to manage this.

For Vue there is already an **awesome** module ( [vue-wait](https://github.com/f/vue-wait) ) which makes this easier but I wanted something quite simple with no additional dependency.

If it's not clear this is highly insipired by *vue-wait*.

To keep it straight forward:

wait module:
```js
export const wait = {
    namespaced: true,
    state() {
        return {
            queue: []
        }
    },
    mutations: {
        start(state, task) {
            state.queue.push(task)
        },
        end(state, task) {
            state.queue = state.queue.filter(item => item !== task);
        }
    }
}
```

how it mutation can be called from other modules:

```js
 async loadData({commit}) {
    commit("wait/start", "load_data", { root: true });
    setTimeout(() => {
        commit("wait/end", "load_data", { root: true });
    }, 2000);
},
```


To get the data in your components:

```js
...
const isLoading = computed(() => store.state.wait.queue.includes("load_data"));
...
```


... or we can have our custom utility function:

```js
export const useWait = (task) => {
    const store = useStore();
    return computed(() => store.state.wait.queue.includes(task));
};
```

and use it like this:
```js
import {useWait} from './store/wait';
const isLoading = useWait("load_data");
```


That's it.
