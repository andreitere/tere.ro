Ok. Starting this again.

While for the past years I maintained a blog I didn't always had the time, motivation or content ideas to properly populate it.

Lately, this changed a bit. I've been gathering a lot of experience, met a lot 
of challenges and I want to share these with you.

I want to share quick tips, scripts, tricks and solutions to any problem I may 
encounter. It probably won't be super detailed as I don't have so much time but I'll try to make it useful.

Also, i'm still working on this website, so there may be some things which are not working as expected or not working at all. Bear with me.

That's it 😌. I hope you'll enjoy it.

🙏🏼
